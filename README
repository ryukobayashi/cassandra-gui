Cassandra GUI
=============

What is it?
-----------

*Cassandra GUI* is a graphical application that allows us to inspect a given
*Apache Cassandra* database instance. You could use it instead of
*cassandra-cli* tool.

How do I run it?
----------------

Simply download *cassandra-gui.jar* and double click on it (on Windows) or
execute a `java -jar cassandra-gui.jar` on a terminal (on Linux/UNIX).

It will prompt you for the host and port of your Cassandra instance.

Are there instructions?
-----------------------

The one thing to keep in mind when using this tool is that in order to see the
records, you must right click on the tree node and select "show 1000 rows".
As an alternative, you could also double click a column family or press ENTER
against it on the left panel. The panel on the right hand side should then
refresh and allow you to explore it.
